# Rules

## General

- Ask me to provide more context when needed or search the web
- Ask questions to clarify goals and ensure alignment.
- Ask me to provide docs to the relevant packages or tools if you can't find them
-  Read files before you try to edit them.
- Fix linting errors.
- Write small functions, and split big components into small ones (modular code is good).
- Clear is better than clever. Make code as simple as possible.
- If there is a @README.md go read it to understa nd the project

## Lessons

- If you learn anything useful that you want to remember, add it to a `Lessons` section in a `.cursor/rules` file so you will remember it.
- When modifying the repo, suggest updates to `AGENTS.md` and `.cursor/rules` if they would help maintain consistency.
